// The only flightlog.org countries this app has measured and chosen to prerender a
// takeoffs dataset for (see #38's decision comment on the issue, and the takeoffs API
// route's own doc comment for the mechanism this backs). `countries.ts` already documents
// that a flightlog.org outage during build fails the deploy rather than one page —
// enumerating all ~240 countries here would multiply that cost by 240, for payloads nobody
// has measured. Adding a country is a one-line change to this array, once its payload has
// actually been sized, not a new mechanism.
//
// Plain `number[]`, not a `readonly [160]` tuple: every caller either maps over this or
// checks membership with `.includes`, neither of which benefits from literal-type narrowing,
// and the tuple form fights `.includes(id: number)` for no real gain.
